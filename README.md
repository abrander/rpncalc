rpncalc
=======

Javascript based RPN calculator. This is a simple calculator inspired by last century Hewlett-Packard calculators. The calculator supports keyboard input, simple operations and an infinite stack. Does not support infix input (but that's a feature).

A live demo can be seen at http://rpncalc.org/.
